{"meta":{"app":"FEATool Multiphysics","author":"Precise Simulation","build":"1.9.1","date":"10-Jan-2019","descr":["This example is a well known benchmark test case from structural mechanics, a thin plate with a circular hole in the center is subjected to a load along one axis.","","The plate is considered to be infinitely long, made of steel and thin enough to satisfy the two dimensional plane stress approximation. Since both the problem and solution will be symmetric around the hole it is enough to model a quarter of the plate. The computational geometry consist of a _0.05_ by _0.05 m_ square with a quarter of a circle with radius 0.005 m removed from the lower left corner. Due to the symmetry the displacement of the left edge of the plate should be zero in the x-direction, and similarly the y-displacement for the lower edge should also be zero. Furthermore, a horizontal force of _1000 N_ is applied to the right outer edge. With a plate thickness of _0.001 m_, the resulting load will be _1000/(2*0.05*0.001) = 10^7 Pa_.","","From linear elasticity theory it is expected that the maximum stress in the direction tangential to the load should be three times the stress of a plate without a hole, that is _sigma_x = 3*10^7 Pa_ [1].","","Reference:","","[1] E.G.
