{"meta":{"app":"FEATool Multiphysics","author":"Precise Simulation","build":"1.9.1","date":"18-Jan-2019","descr":["This example models fluid flow in a narrowing pipe section. The constriction of the pipe will accelerate the flow due to the venturi effect. As the fluid is assumed to be both incompressible and isothermal the problem is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. Although the axisymmetric form of the equations are pre-defined and available, the standard 2D Cartesian equations will be used and modified to demonstrate the PDE customization and equation editing feature.","","In addition to changing the equations, an appropriate boundary condition for the symmetry boundary must be chosen. A homogeneous Neumann insulation/symmetry condition is typically employed for scalar equations, but in the case of fluid flow a slip condition preventing any radial velocity while allowing flow in the axial direction is appropriate.","","The geometry of the problem considers a 2:1 constriction with an initial pipe diameter of _d = 2 m_. The inlet velocity is assumed to be uniform _vin = v(z=0) = 1 m/s_ and the fluid has a density of _rho = 1 kg/m^3_ and viscosity _mu = 0.05 kg/ms_. This gives a Reynolds number of _Re = rho*v*d/mu = 40_, which should result in laminar flow with a parabolic outflow profile."],"dim":2.5,"image":"axisymmetric_flow1.jpg","keyw":["quickstart","axisymmetry","fluid_flow","customization","equation_editing","validation"],"mlver":"R2019a","name":"axisymmetric_flow1","phys":["Navier-Stokes Equations"],"system":"","time":737443,"title":"Axisymmetric Fluid Flow","type":"Fluid Dynamics","user":"precsim","ver":[1,9,1]},
