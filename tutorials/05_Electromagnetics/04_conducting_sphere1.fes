{"meta":{"app":"FEATool Multiphysics","author":"Precise Simulation","build":"1.9.0","date":"21-Feb-2020","descr":["This verification example considers a perfectly conducting sphere placed between two charged capacitor plates. An axisymmetric solution for the electrostatic potential is compared with a full 3D one, and verified against the analytical solution _U(x_i) = E_0*(r^3/x_i^2 - x_i)_, where the electrical field is the potential difference divided by the distance between the plates E_0 = dV/dx.","","In this example the conductive sphere is given a radius of _1 mm_ while the distance between the places is _1 cm_. The area of the places is taken as _0.1 x 0.1 m_ and in axisymmetric coordinates a circle with equivalent area. The applied voltage is _20 V_ and dielectric permittivity of the medium _eps = 5_."],"dim":2,"image":"conducting_sphere1.jpg","keyw":["capacitor","axisymmetry","verification"],"mlver":"R2019a","name":"conducting_sphere1","phys":["Electrostatics"],"system":"","time":737843,"title":"Conducting Sphere","type":"Electromagnetics","user":"precsim","ver":[1,9,0]},
