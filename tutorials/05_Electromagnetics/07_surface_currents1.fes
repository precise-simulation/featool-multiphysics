{"meta":{"app":"FEATool Multiphysics","author":"Precise Simulation","build":"1.16.1","date":"12-Oct-2022","descr":["Skin effect is a phenomenon where an alternating current tends to flow and distribute itself along the surface layer or outside _skin_ of a conductor. This effect can for example be taken advantage of in power transmission applications by layering inexpensive conductor materials (for example aluminium) with a thin layer of more conductive material (like copper). This model examines the skin effect in a two-dimensional cross section of a thick circular wire with an outer radius _R = 12 cm_.","","A time-harmonic complex Helmholtz equation for the amplitude of the electric field _E_ is used to model the skin effect","","-div(1/mu*grad(E)) + k^2E = 0","","where _mu_ is the permeability _pi*4e-7 H/m_, and the wave number _k_ is given by","","k = sqrt(i*omega*sigma - omega^2*epsilon)","","where _sigma_ is the conductivity of the material, _epsilon_ the dielectric properties, and _omega_ angular frequency (here _60 Hz_). Complex (and imaginary) numbers are denoted using the _i_ coefficient."],"dim":2,"image":"surface_currents1.jpg","keyw":["conductor","surface_currents","time_harmonic"],"mlver":"R2019b","name":"surface_currents1","phys":["Custom Equation"],"system":"","time":738806,"title":"Surface Currents in a Circular Wire","type":"Electromagnetics","user":"precsim","ver":[1,16,1]},
