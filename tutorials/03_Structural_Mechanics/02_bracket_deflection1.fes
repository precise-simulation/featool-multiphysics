{"meta":{"app":"FEATool Multiphysics","author":"Precise Simulation","build":"1.9.1","date":"04-Feb-2019","descr":"In this example a three dimensional model of a bracket with a cylindrical hole is subjected to an external load. The vertical side of the bracket is fixed to a wall (thus zero displacement boundary conditions are applied there), while the outer end of the bracket is loaded with a force of _10^4 Pa_ in the negative z-direction. The resulting bracket displacements and deformation are examined.","dim":3,"image":"bracket_deflection1.jpg","keyw":["bracket","deflection"],"mlver":"R2011b","name":"bracket_deflection1","phys":["Linear Elasticity"],"system":"","time":737461,"title":"Deflection of a Bracket","type":"Structural Mechanics","user":"precsim","ver":[1,9,1]},
