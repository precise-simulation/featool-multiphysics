{"meta":{"app":"FEATool Multiphysics","author":"Precise Simulation","build":"1.9.1","date":"01-Feb-2019","descr":["This is a benchmark and validation model for linear elasticity where an elliptical thick plate with a hole is subjected to a uniform pressure load of _1e6 MPa_ [1]. The outer surface is assumed to be constrained from expansion, in addition to the center line which is fixed in the z-direction. Symmetry is also utilized so that only a quarter of the geometry is modeled.","","Reference:","","[1] Davies GAO, Fenner RT, Lewis RW.
