{"meta":{"app":"FEATool Multiphysics","author":"Precise Simulation","build":"1.9.0","date":"20-Feb-2020","descr":["This is a benchmark test case for modeling the steady-state temperature distribution in a thermal bridge in building construction [1]. The model consists of a 6 mm concrete slab subjected to an outside temperature of 0 degrees and heat loss due to convection. The inside features a 4 cm layer of air enclosed within a 1.5 mm metal frame, which is attached to the slab with an insulating layer. The inside temperature is assumed a constant 20 degrees. The model can both be considered to be planar, and also symmetric at the ends so that only a 2D 0.5 m section needs to be modeled. The heat flux and temperature at various points is compared to given reference values [1].","","Reference:","","[1] ISO 10211:2007(en), Thermal bridges in building construction - Heat flows and surface temperatures, Test Case A.2."],"dim":2,"image":"thermal_bridge1.jpg","keyw":["heat_conduction","thermal_bridge","validation"],"mlver":"R2019a","name":"thermal_bridge1","phys":["Heat Transfer"],"system":"","time":737841,"title":"Thermal Bridge","type":"Heat Transfer","user":"precsim","ver":[1,9,0]},
