{"meta":{"app":"FEATool Multiphysics","author":"Precise Simulation","build":"1.9.0","date":"19-Feb-2020","descr":["This is an example of modeling anisotropic heat conduction in an orthotropic material where a heated solid bar suddenly is cooled by submerging it in a cool fluid. The material features different thermal conductivities in the x and y-directions which is accounted for by modifying the diffusion term in the heat transfer equation. Instead of solving the usual isotropic case","","rho*c_p*dT/dt - k*(Txx + Tyy) = 0","","we will instead solve the following","","rho*c_p*dT/dt - (k_x*Txx + k_y*Tyy) = 0","","where _k_x = 34.6147 W/m K_ and _k_y = 6.23687 W/m K_ are the thermal conductivities in the different directions. Fully anisotropic cases can technically also be handled by introducting off-diagonal _k_xy*Txy_ diffusion terms.","","The following material and simulation parameters are given; initial temperature _T_0 = 260 C_ degrees, density _rho = 6407.4 kg/m3_, heat capacity _c_p = 37.688 J/kg K_. Due to symmetry we only need to model a quarter domain of a 2D cross-section with dimensions 5.08 by 2.54 cm. Conductive heat flux boundary conditions are used on the external boundaries with a convection coefficient _h = 1361.7 W/m2 K_ and surrounding temperature _T_inf = 37.7778 C_. The cooling process is simulated for 3 seconds after which the temperature is measured in the center core and corners, and compared to the reference values [1].","","Reference:","","[1] P.J.
