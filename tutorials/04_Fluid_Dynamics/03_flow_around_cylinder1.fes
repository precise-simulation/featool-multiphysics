Although it is not possible to derive an analytical solution to this test case, very accurate numerical solutions to benchmark reference quantities have been established for the pressure difference, drag, and lift coefficient [1],[2].","","The test configuration considers a solid cylinder centered at _(0.2, 0.2)_ with diameter _d = 0.1_ in a _l = 2.2_ by _h = 0.41_ rectangular channel. The fluid is assumed to have a constant density equal to _1_ and viscosity _0.001_. A fully developed parabolic velocity profile is prescribed at the inlet, _u(0,y) = (4*umax*y(h-y)/h^2, 0)_, with a maximum velocity of _umax = 0.3_. This results in the mean velocity _umean = 2/3*umax = 0.2_ and laminar flow with Reynolds number _Re = rho*umean*d/miu = 20_.","","References:","","[1] John V, Matthies G.
