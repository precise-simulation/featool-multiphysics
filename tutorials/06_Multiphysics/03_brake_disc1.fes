{"meta":{"app":"FEATool Multiphysics","author":"Precise Simulation","build":"1.9.1","date":"22-Feb-2019","descr":["Coupled stress-strain and heat transfer simulation of heat induced stresses for one braking cycle. The braking process involves application of a brake pad to the front part of the disc inducing heat through friction, which in turn results in stresses in the brake disc. Both rotational and axial symmetry is used to reduce the computational cost. Material parameters and validation results are given in the reference [1].","","Reference:","","[1] A.
