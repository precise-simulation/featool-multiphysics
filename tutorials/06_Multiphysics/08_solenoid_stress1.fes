{"meta":{"app":"FEATool Multiphysics","author":"Precise Simulation","build":"1.9.0","date":"02-Mar-2020","descr":["This multiphysics model examines how magnetic forces give rise to stresses in a long thick cylindrical solenoid. A current density of _1e6 A/m^2_ is running through a wound coil with _1 cm_ inner to _2 cm_ outer radii. The material of the coil is assumed to have a modulus of elasticity of _1.075e11 N/m^2_ and Poisson's ratio of _0.33_, and air occupies the inner hollow core.","","As this is a one-way coupled problem, the magnetostatic effects will be solved for first, after which the calculated magnetic forces will be used as input to the stress-strain problem. Due to symmetry it is also sufficient to model a 2D axisymmetric cross-section. The resulting magnetic flux density and circumferential stress at _r = 1.3 cm_ will be compared to the theoretical values of _8.798e-3 T_ and _96.71 N/m_, respectively [1].","","Reference:","","[1] Moon FA.
