Although it is not possible to derive an analytical solution to these test cases, numerical solutions to benchmark reference quantities have been established for the beam deformation, drag, and lift forces [1].","","The test configurations consider a solid cylinder centered at _(0.2, 0.2)_ with diameter _d = 0.1_ in a _l = 2.2_ by _h = 0.41_ rectangular channel. The fluid is assumed to have a constant density and viscosity, and a fully developed parabolic velocity profile is prescribed at the inlet. A beam of length _0.4_ and width _0.02_ is fixed to the end of the cylinder.  First a static solution with a Reynolds number _Re = 20_ is considered, and then an instationary solution with _Re = 100_.","","Reference:","","[1] Hron J.
