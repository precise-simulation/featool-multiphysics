{"meta":{"app":"FEATool Multiphysics","author":"Precise Simulation","build":"1.9.1","date":"16-Mar-2019","descr":["This multiphysics model illustrates natural convection effects in a unit square domain using the Boussinesq approximation. The model involves a Navier-Stokes equations physics mode, representing the fluid flow with solid wall or no-slip boundary conditions everywhere. In addition a heat transfer physics mode is added to model the temperature field . The top and bottom boundaries are perfectly insulated while the left boundary is prescribed a unit temperature and the right zero.","","The physics modes are two way coupled through the vertical source term in the Navier-Stokes equations, _Pr*Ra*T_, and the velocities transporting the temperature coming directly from the fluid flow. First, the Prandtl and Rayleigh numbers are set to _Pr = 0.71_ and _Ra = 1e3_, respectively, after which the _Ra_ number will be increased to _1e4_. The references contain benchmark reference and comparison results for a number of quantities such as maximum velocities and the Nusselt number [9,10].","","References:","","[9] D. de Vahl Davis, Natural Convection of Air in a Square Cavity - A Benchmark Solution, Int.
