{"meta":{"app":"FEATool Multiphysics","author":"Precise Simulation","build":"1.10","date":"20-May-2019","descr":"Coupled thermo-mechanical multiphysics simulation of bending of a cantilever beam. The left side of the beam is fixed to a solid wall while the top side is subjected to an elevated external temperature through natural convection. The lower and left side are continuously held at the initial zero temperature. A two-dimensional plane stress approximation is also used, where the material is assumed to have a Poisson ratio of 0.25, modulus of elasticity 30 GPa, and convective heat transfer coefficient 10 W/m/K. All other coefficients are assumed to be equal to one. The temperature influx from the top boundary causes an increased internal temperature and also results in a downward deflection of the beam. After 10 seconds the top surface temperature has risen to 5 degrees and the beam has bent around 0.5-0.6 mm downwards.","dim":2,"image":"thermo_mechanical1.jpg","keyw":["linear-elasticity","thermo-mechanical"],"mlver":"R2019a","name":"thermo_mechanical1","phys":["Plane Stress","Heat Transfer"],"system":"","time":737571,"title":"Thermo-Mechanical Bending of a Beam","type":"Multiphysics","user":"precsim","ver":[1,10,0]},
