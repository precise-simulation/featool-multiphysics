%GRIDCHECK Check grid for errors.
%
%   [ N_ERR, CIND ] = GRIDCHECK( G, ISWARN, I_CHECK ) Checks a grid G for errors.
%   N_ERR returns the number of errors found. CIND is a cell array giving the
%   indices to incorrectly oriented cells, collapsed cells (with zero volume/area),
%   and non-convex cells. ISWARN is a flag to enable/disable warnings. I_CHECK is
%   a flag to choose check/test type (1 = test Jacobian determinant (default),
%   2 = test if polygon points are in clockwise order, 3 = split hexahedra into
%   six tetrahedra).
